      'A fully responsive and interactive personal portfolio website built using React.js to showcase my projects, technical skills, achievements, and academic research. The website includes smooth scroll animations powered by Framer Motion, a detailed "About Me" section, and a dynamic "Projects" section where each project is visually presented using cards with tech stack tags. The "Contact Me" form is fully functional through EmailJS integration, enabling real-time email submissions without a backend. The site is optimized for both desktop and mobile views, reflecting my design sensibility and frontend development proficiency.',

    description:
      'A research-focused review paper proposing the architecture of an IoT-enabled heart rate monitoring system for real-time cardiac anomaly detection and remote health tracking. The study explores existing technologies such as PPG and ECG sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, and Bluetooth communication and analyzes their integration for theoretical system design. Emphasis is placed on communication flow, data interpretation, and feasibility in telemedicine. The paper reviews multiple use-case scenarios and modern healthcare applications, and it was peer-reviewed and published in a Scopus-indexed international journal, highlighting its scholarly value.',

  title: 'Calendar Application (C++)',
  description:
    'A console-based calendar generator built using C++ that displays the calendar of any user-input year with correct day alignment and leap year detection. The program uses built-in date algorithms to compute the first weekday of the year and accurately arranges dates across all twelve months. Special attention is given to leap year logic as per the Gregorian calendar rules, ensuring February has 29 days when appropriate. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of procedural programming, control structures, and modular functions in C++. It serves as a foundational tool to understand date handling, calendar logic, and console-based formatting.',

      'A robust inventory and order management system developed entirely using PL/SQL within an Oracle database. The project focuses on managing medical product data, processing customer orders, and maintaining real-time inventory accuracy using stored procedures, packages, and triggers. Key features include adding new products, validating order quantities against available stock, updating inventory levels dynamically, and ensuring data consistency through transaction control and exception handling. This database-centric project demonstrates expertise in procedural SQL programming and effective management of business logic directly at the database layer.',

The application uses a menu-driven interface allowing users to add new password entries linked to account names and retrieve saved passwords when needed. Passwords are managed using Python dictionaries for efficient key-value storage and retrieval within the program\'s runtime. This project demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts, including data structures, user input handling, and simple CLI design.',

  title: 'Ultrasonic Stick for Visually Impaired',
  description:
    'An assistive smart walking stick designed to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. This hardware project uses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor integrated with an Arduino UNO to detect obstacles in the userâ€™s path within a range of approximately 2 cm to 400 cm. Upon detecting an object within a threshold distance, the system triggers a buzzer to provide immediate audio feedback, allowing the user to be alerted in real-time and navigate safely. The entire setup is lightweight, low-cost, and powered by batteries, making it suitable for everyday use. The project emphasizes practical embedded systems design and demonstrates the application of sensor-based interaction for socially impactful solutions.',
